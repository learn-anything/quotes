# Contribution Guidelines
Ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:
- Search included quotes before adding a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Use the following format: `> "Quote" - Author`
- If you can't find the author of the quote, you can skip adding the author.
- The quote should be put into its appropriate category. Pick the one you think is closest if you are not sure.
- Only add quotes you think are awesome.
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorisation are welcome.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- You can also add related links and repositories in the end.
