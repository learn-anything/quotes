## Art

> Art washes from the soul, the dust from every day life - Pablo Picasso

> I put my heart and soul into my work, and I have lost my mind in the process. - Vincent van Gogh

> Everyone wants to understand art. Why not try to understand the song of a bird? Why does one love the night, flowers, everything around one, without trying to understand them? But in the case of a painting people have to understand. If only they would realize above all that an artist works of necessity, that he himself is only a trifling bit of the world, and that no more importance should be attached to him than to plenty of other things which please us in the world, though we can't explain them. People who try to explain pictures are usually barking up the wrong tree. - Pablo Picasso

> The artist's job is not to succumb to despair but to find an antidote for the emptiness of existence. - Woody Allen

> If you could say it in words, there would be no reason to paint. - Edward Hopper

> The arts put man at the center of the universe, whether he belongs there or not - Kurt Vonnegut

## Awareness

> Today a young man on acid realized that all matter is merely energy condensed to a slow vibration, that we are all one consciousness experiencing itself subjectively, there is no such thing as death, life is only a dream, and we are the imagination of ourselves. Now here’s Tom with the weather

## Books

> The problem with books is that they end. - Caroline Kepnes

> A reader lives a thousand lives before they die. The person who never reads lives only one. - George R. Martin

- She smiled at him. - And then it arose and struck Vimes that, in her own special category, she was quite beautiful; that was the category of all the women, in his entire life, who had ever thought he was worth smiling at. She couldn’t do worse, but then, he couldn’t do better. So maybe it balanced out. She wasn’t getting any younger but then, who was? And she had style and money and common sense and self-assurance and all the things that he didn’t, and she had opened her heart, and if you let her she could engulf you; the woman was a city. - And eventually, under siege, you did what Ankh-Morpork had always done–unbar the gates, let the conquerors in, and make them your own.

## Business

> Stop thinking about making a million dollars and start thinking about serving a million people. - Dharmesh Shah

> … You know throughout the years in business I found something which was I’d always ask why you do things and the answer you invariably get is oh that’s just the way it’s done. Nobody knows why they do what they do. Nobody thinks about things very deeply in business. That’s what I found… - Steve Jobs

> If you know how big the market is, you're too late.

> The best entrepreneurs are not risk-takers. They spend every day reducing risk.

> Startups mostly don't compete against each other, they compete against no one giving a shit.

> Our company is worth nothing. That's the difference between you and I. Business isn't about money to me...

> If tomorrow my company goes under I will just start another paper company. And then another and another and another. I have no shortage of company names.

## Capitalism

> I used to work at McDonald’s making minimum wage. You know what that means when someone pays you minimum wage? You know what your boss was trying to say? It’s like, “Hey, if I could pay you less, I would, but it’s against the law“ - Chris Rock

## Change

> There are decades when nothing happens. There are weeks where decades happen. - Vladimir Lenin

## Choice

> The essence of strategy is choosing what not to do. - M. E. Porter

> If it's not a hell yes, it's a no.

> In the age of information, ignorance is a choice - Donny Miller

## Compassion

> The world has enough for everyone's need, but not enough for everyone's greed. - Gandhi

## Consciousness

> God is consciousness without the sense of self

> The cosmos is within us. We are made of star-stuff. We are a way for the universe to know itself.

> When I let go of what I am, I become what I might be.

> Because you're only free if you refrain from touching the walls of your cell.

> It's all in your head. You just have no idea how big your head is. - Lon Milo Duquette

> When you change the way you look at things, the things you look at change. - Jiddu Krishnamurti

> The ego is an enlightenment trap.

> Meditation is the medicine, mindfulness the diet.

> You must live in the present, launch yourself on every wave, find your eternity in each moment - Thoreau

> Lately it occurs to me, what a long strange trip it's been...

> [Could it be anything but perfect though?](https://www.reddit.com/r/DMT/comments/5pul1f/i_love_you_everything_is_perfect/)

- A man was walking along a river bank when he saw another man on the opposite side. - Hello! he called out, how do you get to the other side of the river? - The man called out in response, you are on the other side of the river!

> [Anxiety's a funny thing. A simple change in perspective and it's just gone. But will it stay gone? That's always the question.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/5b9n3d/philosopher_alan_watts_short_lecture_on_letting_go/)

> We often look, but we rarely see.

> We often hear, but we rarely listen.

- I have seen this as well. It's called ego death. - The past and future do not exist. Only the moment. And in the moment everything exists. Life... existence... reality itself raging forward. You are only random jumble of some matter from a random part of the universe. You are no more important than any other piece of reality. But in the same sense, you are the most important thing in the universe. You are the universe. The universe is within you and you within it. - During ego death you realise this. This fact of existence. You are only another piece of matter. You are exactly the same as a table or chair or the dirt. You are simply matter. Conscious matter. A bunch of atoms with self awareness. Ego death is... in my opinion, the most tangible example of nirvana. It is the greatest form of understanding. - We are all just lucky bundles of atoms experiencing existence together. It makes you chill out and have empathy for other life forms. - We just exist. We are just alive. And we overcomplicate it all. But all life forms have the same basic feelings about stuff.

> The universe is endless, limitless and infinite. Any effort to define it's boundaries is an attempt to overcome ignorance. We are physical, mental and spiritual beings ... there is no beginning and there is no end. There is only memory. Our repeated loss of memory experiences create the illusion of beginnings and ends. Immortality is the ability to retain full memory through all consciousness transformations. Loss of memory is man's greatest curse and, in very real terms, death.

> Let us declare nature to be legitimate. All plants should be declared legal, and all animals for that matter. The notion of illegal plants and animals is obnoxious and ridiculous.

> Although the road is never ending take a step and keep walking, do not look fearfully into the distance... On this path let the heart be your guide for the body is hesitant and full of fear.

> Modern man is a prisoner who thinks he is free because he refrains from touching the walls of his dungeon.

> You are an extra in everyone else's movie

> [God is consciousness without the sense of self](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/5rhm1j/what_does_god_mean_to_you/dd7dywq/)

> [After years of meditation, thousands of out of body experiences and one very significant, particular meditation I've come to the conclusion that I am not in the world, but the world is within me.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/5swt7m/what_is_the_craziest_thought_you_believe_in/ddin787/)

> Heaven, it's anywhere but where you are.

- So then, let’s suppose that you were able every night to dream any dream you wanted to dream, and that you could for example have the power within one night to dream 75 years of time, or any length of time you wanted to have. - And you would, naturally, as you began on this adventure of dreams, you would fulfill all your wishes. You would have every kind of pleasure during your sleep. And after several nights of 75 years of total pleasure each you would say “Well that was pretty great”. But now let’s have a surprise, let’s have a dream which isn’t under control, where something is gonna happen to me that I don’t know what it's gonna be. - And you would dig that and would come out of that and you would say “Wow that was a close shave, wasn’t it?”. Then you would get more and more adventurous and you would make further- and further-out gambles what you would dream. And finally, you would dream where you are now. You would dream the dream of living the life that you are actually living today. - That would be within the infinite multiplicity of choices you would have. Of playing that you weren't god, because the whole nature of the godhead, according to this idea, is to play that he is not. So in this idea then, everybody is fundamentally the ultimate reality, not god in a politically kingly sense, but god in the sense of being the self, the deep-down basic whatever there is. And you are all that, only you are pretending you are not.

> Before enlightenment, chop wood, carry water. After enlightenment, chop wood, carry water.

## Control

> If everything is under control, you're going too slow. - Mario Andretti

## Cosmos

> The cosmos is within us. We are made of star-stuff. We are a way for the universe to know itself. - Carl Sagan

> It is the simplest version of the idea that sticks. - Christopher Nolan

> I have no special talents. I am only passionately curious - Albert Einstein

> If you can’t solve a problem, it’s because you’re playing by the rules.

> Create. Not for the money. Not for the fame. Not for the recognition. But for the pure joy of creating something and sharing it. - Ernest Barbaric

## DMT

> DMT will not teach you anything about this universe. The only guaranteed truths you will find there are about the self. Everything else is just what could be, in my opinion.

## Design

> Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works. - Steve Jobs

> You cannot understand good design if you do not understand people; design is made for people - Charles Eames

## Drugs

> When you drink alcohol you are just borrowing happiness from tomorrow.

> The dose makes the poison.

> Know your body, know your mind, know your substance, know your source.

## Engineering

> A brilliant professor of mine liked to say The Answer of the Engineer: it depends.

## Fear

> Rich people buy things that make them more money; poor people buy big screen TV's and cars - Robert Kiyosaki

> Wealthy is meaningless; use Unwealth: the difference, at any point in time, between what you have and what you would like to have

## Focus

> Do the simple thing first.

> Work like hell. I mean you just have to put in 80 to 100 hour weeks every week. This improves the odds of success. If other people are putting in 40 hour work weeks and you’re putting in 100 hour work weeks, then even if you’re doing the same thing you know that… you will achieve in 4 months what it takes them a year to achieve. - Elon Musk

## Freedom

> Freedom consists of the distribution of power and despotism in its concentration.

> What Orwell feared were those who would ban books. What Huxley feared was that there would be no reason to ban a book, for there would be no one who wanted to read one. Orwell feared those who would deprive us of information. Huxley feared those who would give us so much that we would be reduced to passivity and egotism. Orwell feared that the truth would be concealed from us. Huxley feared the truth would be drowned in a sea of irrelevance. Orwell feared we would become a captive culture. Huxley feared we would become a trivial culture, preoccupied with some equivalent of the feelies, the orgy porgy, and the centrifugal bumblepuppy. As Huxley remarked in Brave New World Revisited, the civil libertarians and rationalists who are ever on the alert to oppose tyranny “failed to take into account man’s almost infinite appetite for distractions.” In 1984, Orwell added, people are controlled by inflicting pain. In Brave New World, they are controlled by inflicting pleasure. In short, Orwell feared that what we fear will ruin us. Huxley feared that our desire will ruin us.

## Friends

> Here’s to the crazy ones, the misfits, the rebels. The package makers, the man page writers. The rounded windows in Qt mixed with the less rounded windows of GTK. The ones who literally see things differently because of missing proprietary fonts.

> The exercises are phenomenal. Though they do range from a stop gap to see if you understand to PhD thesis so it does vary.

> [His communication is great. He's a great communicator. Believe me. He's communicated with a lot of people and he's top notch. Very top notch. A lot of people ask him How do you do it? and trust me when I say, he's great. And we're gonna have a lot more communication with him in charge, you can bet on that. China doesn't even communicate, but I'm telling you, he does it and it's just terrific.](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/5rjv9n/trump_told_australian_prime_minister_refugee/dd7vme2/)

> if you haven’t automatically destroyed something by mistake, you are not automating enough

> A junior software engineer is a function that maps programs to excuses.

> The Muskonauts figured out why their shit exploded. Hackernews, literally all of whom are actual rocket scientists, wonders if unit tests could have helped.

> An astronaut has passed away. He retired from NASA in 1976, since which time humanity has been phoning it in with this whole space-travel scene. Half of Hackernews recognizes this as the massive failure it is; the other half seizes the opportunity to virtue-signal about all the other problems nobody's fixing.

> Some people Instagram their food. On Hackernews, foodie cred is earned by bragging about what you don't eat. Sugar. Bread. Dairy. Meat. Caffeine. All of these are linked by science to early stroke, heart attack, cancer, and/or obesity. In addition, to live a long healthy life you need to tend to the bacteria living in your intestine like a Sea Monkey colony -- and don't forget to meditate frequently. I bet you can figure out where all this is headed -- and yes, when a very scientific study was published indicating eating nothing at all gave you regenerative superpowers, the Hackernews dietary virtue-signalers lost their collective mind.

> [Technologically current X.org resembles a trashcan with rockets taped on it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/5x9gvw/what_are_the_advantages_of_mirwayland_over_xorg/degf6ch/)

## Life

> We thought of life by analogy with a journey, a pilgrimage, which had a serious purpose at the end, and the thing was to get to that end, success or whatever it is, maybe heaven after you’re dead. But we missed the point the whole way along. It was a musical thing and you were supposed to sing or to dance while the music was being played. - Alan Watts

> For a long time it seemed to me that real life was about to begin, but there was always some obstacle in the way. Something had to be got through first, some unfinished business; time still to be served, a debt to be paid. Then life would begin. At last it dawned on me that these obstacles were my life. - Alfred D. Souza

> Absorb what is useful, Discard what is not, Add what is uniquely your own. - Bruce Lee

> Have you ever noticed that when you sit down to write something, half the ideas that end up in it are ones you thought of while writing it? The same thing happens with software. Working to implement one idea gives you more ideas. So shelving an idea costs you not only that delay in implementing it, but also all the ideas that implementing it would have led to. In fact, shelving an idea probably even inhibits new ideas: as you start to think of some new feature, you catch sight of the shelf and think “but I already have a lot of new things I want to do for the next release. - Paul Graham

> Empower people. Embrace change. Eliminate waste.

> Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. - Steve Jobs

> You can’t be free if you judge people

> It’s interesting to think about how profoundly we’re a product of the culture we’re raised in, even to the level of our modes of cognition. We’d all like to think there’s something essential about us as individuals that would persist no matter where or when we were born, but so many of the pursuits that define us are entirely culture-specific. Music seems to be found in all cultures, so maybe a musician would be drawn to music no matter what form it took in the culture she was born into, but what would I be drawn to in a culture without the written word? - Ted Chiang

> If you don’t know where you’re going, any road will get you there. - Cheshire Cat in Alice in Wonderland

> When you change the way you look at things, the things you look at change. - Jiddu Krishnamurti

> Anxiety's a funny thing. A simple change in perspective and it's just gone. But will it stay gone? That's always the question.

> I wish it need not have happened in my time, said Frodo. So do I, said Gandalf, and so do all who live to see such times. But that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us. - The Fellowship of the Ring

> Modern man is a prisoner who thinks he is free because he refrains from touching the walls of his dungeon.

> Before enlightenment, chop wood, carry water. After enlightenment, chop wood, carry water.

> Anyone, no matter how smart or educated, can be tricked and it's impossible to know when the person being tricked is you.

> My mission in life is not merely to survive, but to thrive; and to do so with some passion, some compassion, some humour, and some style.

> I don't think - said Alice; Then you shouldn't talk said the Hatter. - Lewis Carroll, Alice in Wonderland

> For a long time it seemed to me that real life was about to begin, but there was always some obstacle in the way. Something had to be got through first, some unfinished business; time still to be served, a debt to be paid. Then life would begin. At last it dawned on me that these obstacles were my life. - Alfred D. Souza

> I can remember thinking, Oh, someday, like in my mid-thirties maybe, everything's going to just somehow gel and settle, just end. It was like there was this plateau, and it was waiting for me, and I was climbing up it, and when I got to the top, all growth and change would stop. Even exhilaration. But that hasn't happened like that, thank goodness. I think that what we don't take into account when we're young is our endless curiosity. That's what's so great about being human. - From movie “Waking Life

> [Two famous authors, Kurt Vonnegut and Joseph Heller are talking at a party hosted by a billionaire hedge fund manager. Kurt says to Joseph, “You know, this billionaire makes more money in one day than you made in your whole lifetime from your novel Catch-22“. Joe responds, “Yes, but I have something he will never have… enough.](http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2011/09/04/book-review-enough-by-john-c-bogle/)

> You must have a map, no matter how rough. Otherwise you wander all over the place. In The Lord of the Rings I never made anyone go farther than he could on a given day. - Tolkien

> What nicer thing can you do for somebody than make them breakfast? - Anthony Bourdain

## Loneliness

> The self hides in many ways, under every stone, the self can hide in compassion, going to India and looking after poor people, because the self is attached to some idea, faith, conclusion, belief, which makes me compassionate because I love Jesus or Krishna, and I go up to heaven. The self has many masks, the mask of meditation, the mask of achieving the highest, the mask that I am enlightened, that “I know of what I speak.” All this concern about humanity is another mask. So one has to have an extraordinary, subtle, quick brain to see where it is hiding. It requires great attention, watching, watching, watching. - On Mind and Thought, p 133

## Mathematics

> Mathematics requires a small dose, not of genius, but of an imaginative freedom which, in a larger dose, would be insanity. - Angus K. Rodgers

> Fractals are shapes with a non-integer dimension

> She, like many, had always thought that mathematics did not derive its meaning from the universe, but rather imposed some meaning onto the universe. - Ted Chiang

> In mathematics you don't understand things. You just get used to them. - John von Neumann

> Geometry without algebra is dumb! Algebra without geometry is blind! - Hestenes

> Young man, in mathematics you don't understand things. You just get used to them. - John von Neumann

> To consult the statistician after an experiment is finished is often merely to ask him to conduct a post mortem examination. He can perhaps say what the experiment died of. - R. A. Fisher

> Most people who are Bad At Math simply don't have the fundamentals down. It happens in school where, if you don't have a concept well understood, too bad we're onto the next topic. And you don't have the skills to cope with the new topic. You fall behind and it's kind of over unless you really apply yourself. I know this because it happened to me. So what I suggest is, no matter what course you take, start at the very beginning. Even if you think you know it, do all the exercises. You'll build your skills piece by piece much like programming and before long you'll wonder why you found it hard in the beginning. It becomes like programming where even with huge problems you just break them down into smaller and smaller pieces until you can cope.

## Minimalism

> The less I needed, the better I felt - Charles Bukowski

> To attain knowledge, add things everyday. To attain wisdom, remove things every day. - Lao Tzu

> Happiness is the absence of striving for happiness - Zhuang Zhou

> In character, in manner, in style, in all things, the supreme excellence is simplicity. - Henry Wadsworth Longfellow

## Motivation

> If you can't fly, then run. If you can't run, then walk. If you can't walk, then crawl, but whatever you do you have to keep moving forward. - Dr. Martin Luther King

## Nature

- Man is the most insane species. - He worships an invisible God and destroys a visible Nature. - Unaware that the Nature he is destroying is this God he is worshipping.

## Nutrition

> Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants.

## Other

> They love us too much, and understand us too little.

> There are years that ask questions and years that answer. - Zora Neale Hurston

## Physics

> The general principle that any problem you face, no matter how big, can be broken down into smaller and easier to solve problems, recursively, is the most important idea in human history.

> The first gulp from the glass of natural sciences will turn you into an atheist, but at the bottom of the glass God is waiting for you. - Heisenberg

> It's all either order or chaos. You momentarily ordered what was already there in a more structured way. Then when you deleted it, that specific order disappeared. Like a plant assembling itself out of minerals and water and atmospheric compounds, and the dying and decomposing back into them again. The underlying elements are still there, but the structure is gone.

> What is special about atomic theory is the supposition that there is an endpoint to recursive reduction. That at some point you cannot find anything simpler.

> It's not complicated, it's just a lot of it. - Richard Feynman

## Planning

> Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe. - Abraham Lincoln

## Politics

> It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends on his not understanding it - Upton Sinclair

> If you don't read the paper you are uninformed, if you do you are misinformed - Mark Twain

> Democracy is the worst form of government ... except for all those other forms that have been tried from time to time.

> Political battles are won with money not words

## Privacy

> Today's surveillance is extremely stealthy. If a person was following you all day, writing down what you are doing, of course you would care. But the problem today is, most people don't see the person following them.

> There is no cloud, just other people's computers

## Problem Solving

> If you can’t solve a problem, it’s because you’re playing by the rules.

## Products

> Apple often doesn't invent the whole thing, but definitely puts a usable version on the market.

## Programming

> 'The purpose of abstraction is not to be vague, but to create a new semantic level in which one can be absolutely precise' - Edsger Dijkstra

> Hope is not a strategy.

> …You have to say to yourself – “I don’t know what I’m doing. We, as a field, don’t know what we’re doing. We don’t know what programming is, we don’t know what computing is, we don’t even know what a computer is.” And once you truly understand that, once you truly believe that – then you’re free, and you can think anything. - Bret Victor

> A feature that isn't documented is a useless feature.

> A computer is like a violin. You can imagine a novice trying first a phonograph and then a violin. The latter, he says, sounds terrible. That is the argument we have heard from our humanists and most of our computer scientists. Computer programs are good, they say, for particular purposes, but they aren't flexible. Neither is a violin, or a typewriter, until you learn how to use it. - Marvin Minsky

> If it doesn't work right, in what sense does it work at all?

> [Just because you turing-can doesn't mean you turing-should](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMnOEgbm2fE)

> When in doubt, use examples

> Lots of problems arise from a bad understanding of where we should be in the levels of abstraction.

> The goal is not to write code that works, the goal is to write code you keep using but never touch again.

> I have made this function so long only because I did not have the time to make it shorter.

> A programmer will be able to understand a problem in full only when he has solved it at least once.

> Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute. - Hardol Abelson

> Writing programs is just the way you make the machine understand your maths

> It's so fun to stop every now and then when writing a lambda function and think it through all the way to the electrons hitting the monitor, etc.

> Error driven development

> Wait, what? Why does my code depend on that? - Ancient Google proverb.

> The first 90 percent of the code accounts for the first 90 percent of the development time. The remaining 10 percent of the code accounts for the other 90 percent of the development time. - Tom Cargill, Bell Labs.

> The whole point of JavaScript libraries is to abstract away the browser’s internal API and provide a different, better API instead.

> [To be able to speak, one must listen. To be able to write (code), one must read (code)](https://medium.com/@jochasinga/dear-novice-developers-e95ce344de09#.i59gt5nym)

> [The line of code that the developer can write the fastest, the line of code that the developer can maintain the cheapest, and the line of code that never breaks for the user, is the line of code that the developer never had to write.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dl0CbKYUFTY)

> It's better for your tool to be dumb and work in predictable ways than to implement surprising convenience behaviours. The presence of magic numbers set by default is a good indicator that some tool is too smart for its own good and will cause you grief.

## Psychedelics

> When you get the message, hang up the phone. - Alan Watts

> Let us declare nature to be legitimate. All plants should be declared legal, and all animals for that matter. The notion of illegal plants and animals is obnoxious and ridiculous.

> Today a young man on acid realized that all matter is merely energy condensed to a slow vibration, that we are all one consciousness experiencing itself subjectively, there is no such thing as death, life is only a dream, and we are the imagination of ourselves. Now, heres Tom with the weather. - Bill Hicks

> Before enlightenment, chop wood, carry water. After enlightenment, chop wood, carry water.

> It's like explaining what being wet is like to someone that has never seen water

- [Some people say that we’ve been here before.That we don’t live just once, but hundreds of times.](http://www.jamesreads.com/about/) - Some people say that we have soulmates, not just one, but many. And that we meet again and again throughout our lives. - Some people like to keep their minds on other things. And so they spend their whole lives looking for answers to the wrong questions. - But what if the many secrets of life and death were not as unknown as we’ve been taught to believe? - Maybe, if you just shift your mind ever so slightly just an inch to the left you’ll see what I mean. - You’ll know when it happens. It will feel like a hundred sunsets hitting you all at once. - It’s a difficult feeling to explain, maybe you have felt it before. It’s sort of like old friends meeting, or the dawn breaking into the night after a thousand years of darkness. - But if I really told you the secrets of the universe, you probably wouldn’t believe me. - So I am here to remind you of how it used to be. No longer just the distance of a memory but instead something completely clear as if it were only yesterday.

## Relationship

> [If it feels good, stay. If it doesn't, leave.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/5xh2z7/open_relationships/dei0b3f/)

## Science

> If, in some cataclysm, all of scientific knowledge were to be destroyed, and only one sentence passed on to the next generations of creatures, what statement would contain the most information in the fewest words? I believe it is the atomic hypothesis (or the atomic fact, or whatever you wish to call it) that all things are made of atoms—little particles that move around in perpetual motion, attracting each other when they are a little distance apart, but repelling upon being squeezed into one another. In that one sentence, you will see, there is an enormous amount of information about the world, if just a little imagination and thinking are applied.

> You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete.

## Startups

> Take something that people do, and remove a step (or make that step very very easy). That's the key to a successful startup. - Ev Williams

> Focus on selling your product, not selling your company.

> Focus on the long term, and always do what’s right to grow the company and not make short-term decisions. And outlast everyone

> The best startup book is one you never open because you're too busy marketing and building your product.

## Success

> Do the simple thing first.

> Work like hell. I mean you just have to put in 80 to 100 hour weeks every week. This improves the odds of success. If other people are putting in 40 hour work weeks and you’re putting in 100 hour work weeks, then even if you’re doing the same thing you know that… you will achieve in 4 months what it takes them a year to achieve. - Elon Musk

> It’s fine to celebrate success but it is more important to heed the lessons of failure. Success is a lousy teacher. It seduces smart people into thinking they can't lose. - Bill Gates

> Focus is a matter of deciding what not to do. - John Carmack

> Are you moving one step in 20 directions or 20 steps in one direction?

> I am reminded of the story of the great French Marshal Lyautey, who once asked his gardener to plant a tree. The gardener objected that the tree was slow-growing and would not reach maturity for a hundred years. The Marshal replied, In that case, there is no time to lose, plant it this afternoon. - John F. Kennedy

> “Nobody is the boss. The project is the boss.”

> Success is a few simple disciplines, practiced every day; while failure is simply a few errors in judgment, repeated every day.

> Frameworks descend and burn up in the atmosphere like meteors. Technology changes fast enough that today’s problems are never tomorrow’s problems. Historically, our greatest technologies have been created by those who kept digging until they hit bedrock; who understood foundational ideas and technologies well enough to improve upon them.

> The more you know, the more you learn; the more you learn, the more you can do; the more you can do, the more the opportunity - it is very much like compound interest

> Every day we change the world. But to change the world in a way that means anything - that takes more time than most people have. It never happens all at once. It's slow. It's methodical. It's exhausting. We don't all have the stomach for it

> You want to be the first and last mover. Be the company that defines that area : Google / Amazon. Think of the end game, but do start.
